# OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set - phpBB Rule Exclusions Plugin

## Description

This plugin contains rule exclusions for [phpBB](https://www.phpbb.com/), the
flat-forum bulletin board software solution, so it can be run flawlessly
togather with OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set (CRS).

## Installation

For full and up to date instructions for the different available plugin
installation methods, refer to [How to Install a Plugin](https://coreruleset.org/docs/configuring/plugins/#how-to-install-a-plugin)
in the official CRS documentation.

## Testing

After the plugin is enabled, your phpBB instance should work without any
problems possibly caused by CRS (for example, false positives while blocking
requests). If you are still having any problems, please file a new issue on
[github](https://github.com/coreruleset/phpbb-rule-exclusions-plugin).
